# TypeScript Type Error in Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript, specifically in the context of function parameter type checking. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but the code attempts to pass a string as the second argument. This results in a type error during compilation.

The solution demonstrates how to avoid this error by properly type-checking the inputs to the function, perhaps using type guards or more specific type definitions.
